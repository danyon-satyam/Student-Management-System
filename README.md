#### Project Description:

The **Student Management System (SMS)** is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to streamline the management and organization of student data in academic institutions. This system provides functionalities for efficiently handling essential operations such as student enrollment, academic records, and performance monitoring. The project emphasizes automation and user-friendly interaction, minimizing manual intervention, and ensuring accuracy in data processing.

The system was built using a combination of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend, while **PHP** was used for backend logic, supported by a **MySQL** database for data storage and management. The goal of the project was to simplify the administrative tasks of managing student information and provide real-time access to academic progress for students, teachers, and administrators alike.

Key functionalities include:
- **Student Registration**: Allowing students to register and update their personal and academic information.
- **Course Enrollment**: Enabling students to enroll in courses and check course details.
- **Grade Management**: Facilitating the entry, modification, and viewing of student grades by faculty members.
- **Attendance Monitoring**: Recording student attendance and providing access to attendance reports.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Offering administrative control for managing users, courses, and system settings.

#### My Role:

As a **Developer**, I was responsible for both front-end and back-end tasks, collaborating with a team to deliver a fully functional system. Specifically, my contributions were:

- Designing and developing the user interface using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to ensure a responsive and intuitive design.
- Implementing the back-end logic using **PHP**, connecting the application to a **MySQL** database, and ensuring secure data handling.
- Structuring the database to manage large sets of student, course, and faculty data efficiently.
- Testing the system to ensure the accuracy and performance of key features like student registration, grade management, and course enrollment.
- Coordinating with team members to integrate individual components and ensure seamless operation.

The **Student Management System** project enhanced my skills in full-stack web development and database management, reinforcing practical knowledge and collaborative problem-solving in software development.
